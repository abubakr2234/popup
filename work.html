       regulatory requirements in the jurisdictions in which they operate and to <br>
       work towards relevant interational best practice standards.This includes<br>

       ESG risk categories:Category A being business activities with potential<br>
       significant adverse enviromental or social risk and/or impacts that are<br>
            diverse,irreversible, or unprecedented. This category is closely<br>
            monitored through their ESG reports
